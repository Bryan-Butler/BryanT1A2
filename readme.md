#Bryan Butler's T1A2 portfolio website assignment
[My website](https://bryanbutler.netlify.app/)
[My github repository](https://github.com/Pepperz/BryanT1A2)



####Purpose
What is the purpose of my portfolio? it serves as an entry point to expose my self to potential employers by both showing off a website i have created to show off my skills AND providing personal information about myself like contact information or hobbies. I can post about current projects or programs i am working on and update it as i go.

####Functionality
My website hasnt quite hit the mark i wanted it to, originally i wanted to have a dropdown "hamburger" menu tab, that animated by sliding down on hover that when you hovered on a section in that menu, opened another menu to let you navigate to a sub area, i couldnt figure out how to do that myself (atleast not yet) this ended up being a consistent theme for me during this assignment, having bigger goals than what i could manage for right now. Each page has a header navigation bar that links to each other "parent" page, and a footer bar that has clickable image links to my various socials.

Eventually i landed on the curren design, its a simple set of webpages, the first of which is the home page which is also serving as the landing page. Containing an image of myself and a friend of mine, a quick introduction on myself and some attributes i believe i have with some images and titles for each to fill the page more and make it more eye catching.

The next page is the blogs landing page, filled with 5 posts about AI (a personal favourite topic of mine) with AI generated images, wrapped in black border and positioned evenly across the page two wide, wrapping down the page.

After that we have my about me page, two images down the left side with some text about the images on the right, would have liked to reverse wrap the second image and was getting close to figuring that out but couldnt quite get it done without googling an answer so elected not to include it in the end. This page also includes a clickable button for my resume and some links to wikipedia's about my previous work history incase people wern't familiar with those industry's.


####Sitemap

So above we have a simple sitemap, of where each page can directly take you, additionally through the header navigation bar and footer social links you can get to any other parent page, being blogs, about, contact me and home, and my various social platforms.

####Target audience
My target audience is working professionals in the IT industry, not only for web developing but also for software development, to potentially colaborate on projects or maybe even get a job offer. knowing that my skills as a web developer arent *quite* upto par yet i opted to be a bit more personal, trying to sell myself and show that im hardworking rather than showing off by skills. The more i learn and improve my skills, the more i will try sell myself by those skills but still leave some personal selling points also.

####Techstack
During this assignment, i **heavily** used both html and scss. Html forms the basic structure of a webpage and scss (or css) styles it transforming its looks from a rather dull text document to something with character that can be eye catching and fun to use. Additionally i used github to save and update changes as i went along.
